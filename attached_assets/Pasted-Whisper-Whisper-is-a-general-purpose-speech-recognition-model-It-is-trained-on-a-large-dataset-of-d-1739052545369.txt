Whisper
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification. The Whisper v2-large model is currently available through our API with the whisper-1 model name.

Currently, there is no difference between the open source version of Whisper and the version available through our API. However, through our API, we offer an optimized inference process which makes running Whisper through our API much faster than doing it through other means. For more technical details on Whisper, you can read the paper.

Embeddings
Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relatedness between two pieces of text. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks. You can read more about our latest embedding models in the announcement blog post.

MODEL	OUTPUT DIMENSION
text-embedding-3-large
Most capable embedding model for both english and non-english tasks

Moderation
The Moderation models are designed to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies. The models provide classification capabilities that look for content in categories like hate, self-harm, sexual content, violence, and others. Learn more about moderating text and images in our moderation guide.

GPT base
GPT base models can understand and generate natural language or code but are not trained with instruction following. These models are made to be replacements for our original GPT-3 base models and use the legacy Completions API. Most customers should use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

How we use your data
Your data is your data.

As of March 1, 2023, data sent to the OpenAI API is not used to train or improve OpenAI models (unless you explicitly opt in to share data with us).

To help identify abuse, API data may be retained for up to 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law). For trusted customers with sensitive applications, zero data retention may be available. With zero data retention, request and response bodies are not persisted to any logging mechanism and exist only in memory in order to serve the request.

Note that this data policy does not apply to OpenAI's non-API consumer services like ChatGPT or DALLÂ·E Labs.

* Chat Completions:

Image inputs via the o1, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, chatgpt-4o-latest, or gpt-4-turbo models (or previously gpt-4-vision-preview) are not eligible for zero retention.
Audio outputs are stored for 1 hour to enable multi-turn conversations, and are not currently eligible for zero retention.
When Structured Outputs is enabled, schemas provided (either as the response_format or in the function definition) are not eligible for zero retention, though the completions themselves are.
When using Stored Completions via the store: true option in the API, those completions are stored for 30 days. Completions are stored in an unfiltered form after an API response, so please avoid storing completions that contain sensitive data.
** Assistants API:

Objects related to the Assistants API are deleted from our servers 30 days after you delete them via the API or the dashboard. Objects that are not deleted via the API or dashboard are retained indefinitely.
Evaluations:

Evaluation data: When you create an evaluation, the data related to that evaluation is deleted from our servers 30 days after you delete it via the dashboard. Evaluation data that is not deleted via the dashboard is retained indefinitely.
For details, see our API data usage policies. To learn more about zero retention, get in touch with our sales team.
